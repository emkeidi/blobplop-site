# BlobPlop Website

You are currently reading about the code behind [blobplop.com](https://blobplop.com).

## BlobPlop uses the following

1. [Astro](https://astro.build/): a speedy web framework with tons of flexibility. Excellent docs. Helped me learn
2. [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): the super-long class names provider!
3. [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/): component library for Tailwind that shortens some of those class names and offers huge help with theming.
